The Manhattan distance, also known as the L1 distance, is a measure of the distance between two points in a multi-dimensional space.
It is calculated as the sum of the absolute differences of their coordinates.

An example of how to calculate the Manhattan distance between two points in a 2D space:

Point A: (2, 3)
Point B: (5, 7)

To calculate the Manhattan distance between these two points, we will take the absolute difference of their x-coordinates and
add it to the absolute difference of their y-coordinates:

|2 - 5| + |3 - 7| = 3 + 4 = 7

So the Manhattan distance between Point A and Point B is 7.

Here is another example:

Point A: (4, 5, 6)
Point B: (1, 2, 3)

To calculate the Manhattan distance between these two points, we will take the absolute difference of their x-coordinates and
add it to the absolute difference of their y-coordinates and z-coordinates:

|4 - 1| + |5 - 2| + |6 - 3| = 3 + 3 + 3 = 9

So the Manhattan distance between Point A and Point B is 9.

It is also important to know that this method is not a proper distance metric as it does not satisfy the triangle inequality and
is only used in some optimization problems.

The use of Manhattan distance is common in problems such as the travelling salesman problem, where the objective is to find the shortest path that visits a certain
set of points, and the distance between points is measured using the Manhattan distance.

The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a well-known problem in combinatorial optimization. It asks the following question:
"Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and
returns to the origin city?"

An example of how the TSP could be approached:

1. Start by creating a list of all the cities and the distances between them.

2. Begin by visiting the first city.

3. At each step, choose the next city that minimizes the total distance traveled so far.

4. Keep track of the total distance traveled and the path taken.

5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until all cities have been visited.

6. Once all cities have been visited, compare the total distance traveled to the distance of all other paths and select the shortest one.

The TSP is a NP-hard problem, meaning that it's very difficult to find an exact solution for large numbers of cities.
However, there are approximate algorithms that can be used to find near-optimal solutions, such as the nearest neighbour algorithm, the 2-opt algorithm,
or the simulated annealing algorithm.

The most important aspect of solving the TSP is finding the best algorithm for the problem at hand.
The complexity of the algorithm depends on the size of the problem and the required precision.
