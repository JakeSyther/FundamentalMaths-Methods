A cross product, also known as the vector product, is a mathematical operation that takes two vectors and returns a third vector that is perpendicular
to both of the input vectors. The magnitude of the resulting vector is equal to the product of the magnitudes of the input vectors multiplied
by the sine of the angle between them, and the direction of the resulting vector is given by the right-hand rule.

An example of how to calculate the cross product of two vectors, A and B, in 3D space:

Step 1: Identify the two vectors that you want to take the cross product of. For example:
--------------
A = <3, 4, 2>
B = <5, -1, 6>
--------------


Step 2: Use the cross product formula to calculate the components of the resulting vector. The formula is:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
C = <Ay * Bz - Az * By, Az * Bx - Ax * Bz, Ax * By - Ay * Bx>
----------------------------------------------------------------------

so in this case:
-------------------------------------
Cx = 4 * 6 - 2 * -1 = 24 - -2 = 26
Cy = 2 * 5 - 3 * 6 = 10 - 18 = -8
Cz = 3 * -1 - 4 * 6 = -3 - 24 = -27
-------------------------------------


so the result of cross product is :
------------------
C = <26, -8, -27>
------------------

You can also use the determinant of the matrix formed by the vectors as columns to calculate the cross product:
-------------------------------------
| i  j  k |
| Ax Ay Az|
| Bx By Bz|
-------------------------------------







----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here's an example of how to calculate the cross product of two vectors in 2D space:
--------------
A = <2, 4>
B = <6, -3>
--------------


The cross product of two vectors in 2D space is a scalar, not a vector. The formula for the cross product of two 2D vectors is:
------------------------------
C = Ax * By - Ay * Bx
------------------------------

so in this case:
-------------------------------------
C = 2 * -3 - 4 * 6 = -6 + 24 = 18
-------------------------------------
So the cross product of vectors A and B is 18.

It's worth mentioning that the cross product is not commutative, meaning the order of the vectors matters, A x B != B x A.
